## üåü What is Pipe Firestarter?

Pipe Firestarter represents a revolutionary approach to decentralized storage and content delivery. Think of it as a blockchain-powered fusion of Google Drive's storage capabilities with Cloudflare's global content delivery network, but completely decentralized.

### Key Features:
- **Decentralized Infrastructure**: No single point of failure
- **Solana-Powered**: Built on one of the fastest blockchains
- **Massive Scale**: Already storing 1 petabyte of Solana's blockchain data
- **Performance**: Reduces validator sync times by approximately 30%
- **Economic Model**: $PIPE token ecosystem with burn-and-mint mechanics
- **Privacy**: Built-in encryption for sensitive data
- **Global Delivery**: Low-latency worldwide content distribution

### How It Works:
Instead of storing your files on centralized servers owned by big tech companies, Pipe Firestarter distributes them across a network of independent node operators. When you pay with $PIPE tokens, those tokens are burned and then re-minted as rewards for the node operators who store and serve your data.

```

**What this does**: Downloads and runs the official Rust installation script securely.

After installation, activate Rust in your current shell:
```bash
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

### For macOS Users:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Then activate Rust:
```bash
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

### Verify Installation:
Let's confirm Rust and Cargo are properly installed:
```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

**Expected Output**: You should see version numbers for both rustc (Rust compiler) and cargo (Rust package manager).

cd pipe
```

**What this does**: 
- Clones the entire Pipe repository to your local machine
- Changes into the pipe directory to begin installation

### Step 2: Build and Install pipe-cli
This step compiles the Rust code and installs the Pipe CLI tool:

```bash
cargo install --path
```

**What this does**: 
- Compiles all the Rust source code
- Installs the `pipe` command-line tool globally on your system
- This may take several minutes depending on your system's performance

### Step 3: Verify Installation

## üë§ User Account Setup

### Step 1: Create Your Pipe User Account
Initialize your Pipe Firestarter user account:

```bash
pipe new-user <your_username>
```

**Important Notes**:
- Replace `<your_username>` with your desired username (no spaces or special characters)
- **Save the `Solana Pubkey` that gets generated** - you'll need this later
- This pubkey is your unique identifier on the Solana blockchain

**Example**: `pipe new-user satyamjha`

### Step 2: Set Up Account Security
Create a secure password for your account:

```bash
pipe set-password
```

**Security Tips**:
- Use a strong, unique password
- Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Don't reuse passwords from other services
- Consider using a password manager

### Step 3: Backup Your Credentials
Your account credentials are stored in a JSON file. Let's view and backup this critical information:

```bash
nano ~/.pipe-cli.json
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Copy and securely store ALL the information in this file:
- Your username
- Solana public key
- Private key information
- Any other configuration data

**Security Note**: Never share this file or its contents with anyone. Store it securely offline as a backup.

## üí∞ Getting PIPE Tokens

### Step 1: Get Solana Devnet Tokens
Since Pipe currently operates on Solana's development network, you need Devnet SOL tokens:

**Get Free Devnet SOL**: Visit [Solana Faucet](https://faucet.solana.com/)
- Enter your Solana public key (from your credentials file)
- Request devnet SOL tokens (usually 1-2 SOL per request)
- Wait for confirmation

### Step 2: Swap SOL for PIPE Tokens
Exchange your Devnet SOL for PIPE tokens:

```bash
pipe swap-sol-for-pipe <AMOUNT_SOL>
```

**Important Guidelines**:
- Replace `<AMOUNT_SOL>` with the amount you want to swap (e.g., `1.5`)
- **Minimum swap amount**: 1 SOL
- **Exchange rate**: Approximately 1 PIPE ‚âà 1 GB of storage
- **Example**: `pipe swap-sol-for-pipe 2`

**What happens**: 
- Your SOL gets converted to PIPE tokens
- These tokens are used to pay for storage and bandwidth
- The swap is recorded on the Solana blockchain

```bash
pipe upload-file <FILE_PATH> <FILE_NAME>
```

**Parameter Explanation**:
- `<FILE_PATH>`: The location of your file on your computer
- `<FILE_NAME>`: What you want to name the file in Pipe storage

**Examples**:
- `pipe upload-file ~/Documents/report.pdf my-report`
- `pipe upload-file /home/user/video.mp4 demo-video`
- `pipe upload-file ./image.jpg profile-picture`

**File Path Tips**:
- For files in your home directory: `~/filename`
- For files in current directory: `./filename`
- For absolute paths: `/full/path/to/file`

**Important Security Notes**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER upload confidential files** like wallet private keys, personal documents, or sensitive data
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Files are stored on a decentralized network** - assume they could be accessible to others
